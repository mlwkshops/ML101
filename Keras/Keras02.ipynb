    "Evaluating a model requires splitting your available data into three sets:\n",
    "training, validation, and test set. You train on the training data, and evaluate your model\n",
    "on the validation data. Once your model is ready for prime time, you test it one final time\n",

    "## Best practice\n",
    "There is no standard way of dividing the dataset between training, validation and testing datasets.\n",
    "As a common rule of thumb, it is advised to split the dataset in training and testing set in the following ratio (Paretos principle):<br>\n",
    "&emsp;Training:Testing = 80:20<br>\n",
    "And use the following ratio for dividing into training, validation and testing:<br>\n",
    "&emsp;Training:Validation:Testing = 60:20:20<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pitfalls\n",
    "While dividing the dataset into training and testing, special care is necessary to make sure that both the train and test dataset contain enough examples for each classification. This requires knowledge about the dataset. Failure to do so can result in bad network performance. For example, if the MNIST dataset were sorted according to digits, we would not be able just take the first 60000 indices because this would lead to misrepresentation of digit 8 and 9.<br>"
